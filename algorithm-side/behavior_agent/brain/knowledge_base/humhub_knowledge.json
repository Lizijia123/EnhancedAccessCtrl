  "func_description": "Humhub is a social networking platform. Its main functions include user management, space management, content management, etc. Users can create spaces, post comments in spaces, like comments; follow certain spaces or other users; edit personal profiles, and so on. System administrators can perform various management configurations on the platform. The main access control model of the platform is RBAC. Unauthorized API calls include vertical privilege escalation (invoking illegal APIs) and horizontal privilege escalation (invoking legal APIs with illegal parameters). There is one registered administrator user and several ordinary users in the system, and there are also some spaces, comments, etc.",
