  "func_description": "Collegeerp is a university management system. Its main functions include the management of courses, classes, attendance, and scores. There are three types of users in the system: administrators, teachers, and students. Students can view the scores and attendance of courses; teachers can view the schedule and manage courses and scores; administrators have more management functions. The main access control model of the platform is RBAC. Unauthorized API calls include vertical privilege escalation (invoking illegal APIs) and horizontal privilege escalation (invoking legal APIs with illegal parameters).",
