  "func_description": "Memos is a memo management system. Users can publish and manage memos, upload and manage file resources, and manage their own information, etc. The roles in the system include users who are not logged in, ordinary users who have logged in, and administrator users. The system adopts the RBAC access control management model. Unauthorized situations include vertical privilege escalation (invoking illegal APIs) and horizontal privilege escalation (invoking legal APIs with illegal parameters). Currently, one administrator and several ordinary users are registered in the system, and there are already some memos, file resources, labels, etc.",
